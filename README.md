# keyChainLoginApp
Portfolio application developed to present my skills.

keyChainLoginApp has the following functionality:

it takes information information from the user via the text fields
when button "register/login" is pressed the data from the text fields is saved to keychain
on the second screen the labels display the user information according to his login input
if the user has already registered previously and dosent remember his password he can enter the login and press on the "forgot password" button
he will see an alert controller that reminds him of the password for the user name he entered so he can login again

several alert controllers are implemented such as to check if the user has not entered any info - this will prevent the transition to the next screen

keyboard navigation is also implemented - user can move from one text field to another using the keyboard button and after all info is entered the "done" button initiates the transition if all is entered correctly
